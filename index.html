        <p>Hello, My name is Rafael Cerda, I am 21 years old born in Houston, Texas and raised in Austin, Texas
            Throught my life ive been confused on what I wanted to do as a career. I had an idea that it had to include
            a fun and friendly environment. It had to include a persons creativity and dedication. Thats when I discovered coding.  
        </p>
        <p>Coding got my attetnio because of the concept it has. You start from nothingness and end with something incredidle.
            A great analogy ive used before would be the famously toys called Legos. You get all these pieces which represent
            a code. You end up finishing your set and you have a final product, Which can then be modified to become even better 
            and better. 
        </p>
